# Coordinate - Coordinate - Frame Selector and Coordinate Keeper
## Overview

Coordinate is a Python script designed to simplify the task of selecting frames and keeping track of their coordinates. This tool is especially useful for anyone working with images, animations, or video editing where precise frame selection and alignment are crucial. You can also use this script in conjunction with ChatGPT to find the longest x and y axes and center your frames. Though it currently lacks a 'Turn into GIF' feature, it offers a streamlined way to manage your frames.
