Coordinate - Frame Selector and Coordinate Keeper
Overview

Coordinate is a Python script designed to simplify the task of selecting frames and keeping track of their coordinates. This tool is especially useful for anyone working with images, animations, or video editing where precise frame selection and alignment are crucial. You can also use this script in conjunction with ChatGPT to find the longest x and y axes and center your frames. Though it currently lacks a 'Turn into GIF' feature, it offers a streamlined way to manage your frames.
Features

    Frame selection with GUI support
    Coordinate saving for easy reference
    Compatibility with ChatGPT for additional calculations like axis length and frame centering
